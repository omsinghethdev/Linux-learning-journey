##Day04 Revision of absolute and relative path cleared the differnce btw absolute and relative path.
What i have learned 
Absolute path: -starts from '/'.
	       -it defines complete path to a file
	       -it work from every where no matter where you are present
example:/home/om-kumar-singh/Downloads


Relative path:it depents on your current working directory in which youe are present .
 eample:if you are in /home/om-kumar-singh now want to go to Downloads which is present in the present directory
	Then you will us relatine path
	cd Download
	some more command :cd .. it goes one level up from the present working directory.
	like when you use cd .. if your pwd is /home/om-kumar-singh/Download
	now you will be in /home/om-kumar-singh one level up.
