##Today learned and practiced how to work with txt file.
1.reading  file(small & large)
-we can read a txt file by 'cat' command 
for exmple: cat first.txt
it shows the content of the file in the terminal u can use f(forward) and b(backward) keys , 
-'less'command use to see the content of txt file in the terminal .we can also navigate by percentage of our content like 50p
use '=' sign to see the current possition and we can also use '-N'to display the row numbers

'cat'is insufficiant for long files because it takes quite long to .
Now talk about geting size of a file
(A):'wc(word count)'
ex:wc filename
wc lwc filename
l-counts the line
w-counts the word
c-counts the number of bytes/8 bit ascii characters
(B):get the size of a file we use 'du'
ex : du -s filename here s for summary.
2 .Editing txt file
for editig we use text editors ex:nano/pico ,vim/vi
simpaly we download this txt editors and use it 
ex: nano filename
